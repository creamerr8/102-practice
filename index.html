        <P>
            Hi! My name is Ryan Creamer! I am currently enrolled at CodeFellows in Seattle Washington. <br>
            I am taking these courses to laern and grow my knowladge in software development to become a software developer. <br>
            I have played a little bit with very basic HTML, CSS, and Python on my own, but knowing myself I could not sit down <br>
            and learn this on my own, so I decided this was the best fit for me. I love playing with computers and building the computer <br>
            itself, then when i started messing with programing tools I found another love for computers and what they can do, and what I can do.
        </P>
